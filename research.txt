Anthropic platform engineering opportunities and positioning strategy

Anthropic is actively scaling its infrastructure team with 14+ open platform and infrastructure engineering positions, presenting an exceptional opportunity for platform engineers with the right skills and mission alignment. Based on comprehensive research of their hiring priorities, technical stack, and recent developments, here's your strategic positioning guide.
Critical infrastructure roles await immediate filling

Anthropic's most relevant opening is the Staff Infrastructure Engineer for the Discovery Team in San Francisco, requiring 3+ years of large-scale distributed systems experience. This role directly supports their AI scientist team building "scientific AGI" and involves designing infrastructure for training, evaluation, and deployment at massive scale. The position emphasizes Kubernetes orchestration, Terraform infrastructure-as-code, and distributed data pipelines - core platform engineering competencies. Additional roles include Engineering Managers for Inference, ML Acceleration, and Performance, plus multiple reliability engineering positions from junior to staff level.

Strategic positioning for Aaron Herres's background

Research reveals Aaron Herres (github.com/redaphid) brings strong IoT and system automation experience from developing "The Tentacle" library at Octoblu, enabling code-free microcontroller programming through cloud platforms. While lacking visible MCP or AI experience, his demonstrated abilities in hardware interfaces, Node.js development, and creating developer-friendly abstractions translate well to AI infrastructure challenges.

To bridge this gap, Aaron should immediately: build and open-source MCP server implementations showcasing his integration expertise, complete Anthropic's MCP Coursera course for credibility, contribute to the MCP ecosystem on GitHub,
